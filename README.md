# Chat App

A backend application for handling a chat application <br/>
App is responsible for crating new sub-application each will have a number of chats and each chat can have a number of messages<br/>
This is a Ruby on Rails application. MySQL is used as a DB, Redis for caching, Rabbit MQ as broker and Elasticsearch for searching messages 

## Description

The application allows user creating new applications where
each application will have a token (generated by the system) and a name(provided by the user). <br/>
The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application.
Each application can have many chats. a chat have a number. <br/>
Numbering of chats in each application starts from 1 and no two chats in the same application will have the same number. <br/>
The number of the chat is returned in the chat creation request. A chat
contains messages and messages have numbers that start from 1 for each chat. The number of the message is also returned in the message creation request.<br/>
The client identifies the application by its token and the chat by
its number along with the application token. <br/>
Transactions with isolation level serializable are being used for chats and messages creation in order to avoid race conditions. <br/>
There is an endpoint for searching through messages of a specific chat using Elasticsearch<br/> 

## Installation

Clone the Github repository and use docker to start the application <br/>
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hazem-elsaayed/chat-app.git
$ cd chat-app
$ docker-compose up
```
Wait for some time unitll docker fetches the images, build and run them then make sure this message appears in the terminal window `Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000` and default rails page is running on `http://localhost:3000`. <br/>


## Notes
To avoid race conditions for creating chats and messages, rabbit mq is used so the requests will be published to a queue and will be consumed (one by one) by one consumer which will then create them in DB </br>
For updating endpoints, DB locks are used to permit only one request to update the row so if one transaction is updating the row the second transaction will be forced to wait until the first is completed and the lock is released before it can make updates. </br>
